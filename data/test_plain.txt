"Why do you always look at the sky like that?" asked Elara, her eyes narrowed with curiosity.
Jareth paused, as if considering the question for the first time. He then looked up, his face softening. "The stars... they remind me of something," he murmured, almost to himself.

Elara tilted her head, stepping closer. "What do they remind you of?"
"Of all the things that are far away, yet seem so close," Jareth replied, his voice distant. "Of places I’ll never see, and people I’ll never meet."

There was a long silence. Elara couldn't quite understand what he meant, but she felt a strange sense of longing in his words. "I don’t think I understand," she admitted.

Jareth smiled faintly, the kind of smile that seemed to hold secrets. "That’s okay. Not everything has to be understood. Sometimes, it's enough just to feel."

Elara studied him for a moment, trying to piece together the mystery that was Jareth. But he was like the stars he admired—beautiful, distant, and impossible to fully comprehend.
